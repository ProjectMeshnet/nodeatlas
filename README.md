NodeAtlas is a high-performance and very portable tool for
geographically mapping mesh networks. It is used and designed by
[ProjectMeshnet][atlas].

It runs as a server which provides a web interface with two parts: a
map, and an API. The mapping portion provides a comfortable and
functional user interface using [Bootstrap][]. The map itself is
provided by [Leafletjs][], which loads tiles from [OpenStreetMap][]
(by default). Nodes are loaded by [JQuery][] from the API.

The NodeAtlas itself is written in [Go][], and its API is powered by
[JAS][], a RESTful JSON API framework.

It is highly configurable, and designed with the diversity of
different mesh networks in mind. The default configuration is tweaked
toward the needs of [Project Meshnet][pm], but it is simple to
configure.
